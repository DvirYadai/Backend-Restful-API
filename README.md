# Welcome to my Backend-Restful-API project!

## How to run the server in your computer.

- First download the repo to your computer.
- And now all you need to do is open the start.bat file and the server will automatically run in http://localhost:3000
- If you want to close the server go to the cmd window that opened when you clicked on the start.bat file and press ctrl + c, the server will ask you if you want to close the server.
- Type `y` and press enter to close the server, otherwise type `n`.

### Hope you enjoy!
